Description: Machine learning provides algorithms that can learn from data and make inferences or predictions. Stochastic automata is a class of input/output devices which can model components. This work provides implementation an inference algorithm for stochastic automata which is similar to the Viterbi algorithm. Moreover, we specify a learning algorithm using the expectation-maximization technique and provide a more efficient implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for stochastic automata. This work is based on Inference and learning in stochastic automata was by Karl-Heinz Zimmermann(2017) <doi:10.12732/ijpam.v115i3.15>.
